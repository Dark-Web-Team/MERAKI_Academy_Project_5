## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The idea of this project came because of the lack of such websites in the area. So this website serves as a connection ring between users who want to book places providing sports/entertainment services and business owners who provide those services near them.

The user can view different business based on category, or search for specific business based on price or city to his preference, as well as chat with the business owner and pay for the booking online using credit card
